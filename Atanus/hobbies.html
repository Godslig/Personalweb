      I really enjoy playing chess with my friends.<br> What makes chess my my favourite game is that it requires critical thinking around
      research.<br> So one can only predict the winner if he what techniques the opponents has and how to over come them which literally
      impossible.<br> Most times in abscence of people(friends), I play chess on my component however tough movements may be. <br>Below is an 
      image of my computer chess  board.

        <br><br><br> The other hobby that enjoy is play pooltable.<br> This one requires high skills and regular practice for perfection and accuracy.
         <br> Pooltable playing involves two opponents and the <br>winner hits all his balls inside with the last black ball.
